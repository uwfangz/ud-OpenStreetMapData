## Map area

Bellevue, WA, United States
* https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/237868

This is the map of the city I live in. I'm intersted to know what SQL queries would reveal about the database. 

## Problems encountered in the map

* [Problematic formats of postal codes](#postal-codes) (include street name, state, and problematic formats of postal codes, e.g., *"981-2"*, and *"980452"*.)
* [Inconsistent postal codes](#postal-codes) (Most postal codes are 5-digit, with some exceptions of 4-digit extensions following a hyphen.) 
* [Overabbreviated street names](#overabbreviated-and-misspelled-street-names)
* [Street names with "FIXME"](#fixme-street-names)

### Postal Codes

Running the data against *audit_post_code.py*, I get the following results:

```Python
{'980452': 1, '981-2': 1, 'W Lake Sammamish Pkwy NE': 1, 'WA': 2}
```
There are street name, state name, and problematic formats of zip codes in this dataset. First, I need to categorize the data correctly. For the street name and state name, I can change their 'k' values to 'addr:street' and 'addr:state' respectivley so that they won't appear as post codes. 

Then I try to figure out the correct zip codes for *"980452'* and *"981-2"*. Running the SQL query, I can get the latitude and longitude values of the node the *'addr:postcode'* tag is attached to. So here I first run the query with *"980452'*: 

```Sql
SELECT nodes.lat, nodes.lon
FROM nodes
    JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT(id) FROM nodes_tags WHERE value='980452') i
    ON nodes.id=i.id;
```
```Sql
47.6732445|-122.1196970
```
After searching the latituide and longitude values above in Google map, I get the correct zip code *98052* for *"980452'*. 

I try to change the value to *"981-2"* and run the code. However, I couldn't get anything by searching the nodes id when *'addr:postcode'* equals to *"981-2"*. It turns out that this zip code is under the *"relations"* structure. Considering the fact that the relations table is not included in the database file, I leave the value as it is. 

Below is the function I use to update the post codes:

```Python
mapping = { "980452": "98052"}

def update(postcode, mapping): 
    # update the entry with correct zip code:
    if postcode in mapping:
        postcode = mapping[postcode]
    else:  # update all 9-digit zip codes to 5 digits
        postcode = postcode.split("-")[0]  
    return postcode
```
This should update the incorrect post codes and make all post codes 5 digits. 

### Street Names

There are quite a few street names ending with house/apartment/suite numbers. There's a street name ending with "wa". The whole entry is *"144th pl ne bellevue wa"*. Here, "wa" should refer to the state name and "bellevue" is the city name. I would change this entry to "144 pl ne" when I clean the data. 

#### Overabbreviated and misspelled street names

I've created a *mapping* variable to map out the words that needs correction, e.g., words that are not capilized or misspelled and abbreviated. After having my *mapping* variable, I use the following function to correct them in *update_street_names.py*:

```Python
def update(name, mapping): 
	if name == "144th pl ne bellevue wa":
		name = "144th pl ne"
	words = name.split()
	for w in range(len(words)):
		if words[w].lower() in mapping:
			words[w] = mapping[words[w].lower()]
			if words[w] == "Suite":  # For example, don't update 'Suite E' to 'Suite East'
				break
	name = " ".join(words)
	return name
```
This would update all overabbreviated street names, i.e., *"144th pl ne"* becoming *"144th Place Northeast"*.

#### FIXME street names

In addition, there are 8 street names that have values as "FIXME". According to OpenStreetMap Wiki, it is a *"description of a (possible) error in the map"*. I try to look up the street names using the latitude and longitude values. 

```sql
sqlite> SELECT nodes.id, nodes.lat, nodes.lon
FROM nodes
    JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT(id) FROM nodes_tags WHERE value='FIXME') i
    ON nodes.id=i.id;
```
Below are the node latitude and longitude values of these *"FIXME"* tags:

```sql
1191705889|47.6170688|-122.0261962
1191705928|47.6171547|-122.0264728
1191705942|47.6171423|-122.0266199
1191705960|47.6170953|-122.0267518
1191705978|47.6170927|-122.0268947
1191705997|47.6171638|-122.0269996
1191706019|47.6172568|-122.0269602
1191706040|47.6172459|-122.0270917
```
Using google map, I've come to the conclusion that these nodes are all on the same street, *"235th Avenue Northeast"*.
So I add *{"FIXME": "235th Avenue Northeast"}* to my *mapping* variable before I start to clean the data.

FROM nodes_tags
WHERE key='amenity'
GROUP BY value
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql

bar|225
bank|224

```
### Most popular cafes
Not surprisingly, cafe makes to the fifth place on the list. Since Seattle is the place where Starbucks is from, I wonder if there are also many Starbucks in Bellevue.

```sql
sqlite> SELECT nodes_tags.value, COUNT(*) as num
FROM nodes_tags 
    JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT(id) FROM nodes_tags WHERE value='cafe') i
    ON nodes_tags.id=i.id
WHERE nodes_tags.key='name'
GROUP BY nodes_tags.value
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
```sql
Starbucks|127
Top Pot Doughnuts|12
Caffe Ladro|11
Cherry Street Coffee House|9
Tully's Coffee|9
```
Starbucks is the most popular cafe in Bellevue. It has way 10 times more shops than the other cafes.

### Most popular cuisines

```sql
sqlite> SELECT nodes_tags.value, COUNT(*) as num
FROM nodes_tags 
    JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT(id) FROM nodes_tags WHERE value='restaurant') i
    ON nodes_tags.id=i.id
WHERE nodes_tags.key='cuisine'
GROUP BY nodes_tags.value
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
```sql
pizza|111
mexican|110
thai|86
chinese|85

```
Asian restaurants seem popular in Bellevue.

# Conclusion

I’ve cleaned most parts of the data for this project. However, there are some parts that I didn’t touch. For instance, when I try to see the most popular cafes in Bellevue, I’ve discovered that some cafes have location in their names, e.g., “Zoka Coffee”, “Zoka Coffee - Kirkland”. I know that they are actually the same cafe, but since they have different location attached to the cafe name, SQL query counts them as two different cafes. If my analysis focuses on the cafes in Bellevue, I need to do a close auditing and cleaning on the cafe names.
